# Set theory clock

Deployed to [clock.jamessw.com](https://clock.jamessw.com/).

This is an implementation of the [Mengenlehreuhr clock](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mengenlehreuhr), found in Berlin.

Developed as an exploration of CSS Nesting and the `prefers-color-scheme` and `prefers-contrast` media queries. It will not work on browsers without CSS Nesting support.
